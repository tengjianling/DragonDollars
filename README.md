# DragonDollars
An IOS application that encourages users to put money into their savings account



##Inspiration 

We give credit to this reddit post for the motive behind building this app, which is to encourage financial savings through the use of a virtual pet. The concept of our application (using a mythical creature and feeding/customisation tasks) is completely original though! https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightbulb/comments/43ljd4/a_virtual_pet_that_requires_the_same_level_of/



## What it does

Dragon Dollars incentives users to practice good saving habits through long-term taking care of their virtual pet dragon! The game requires users to connect 2 bank accounts, one for making in-game payments and another savings account. Whenever an in-game purchase is made, funds will be transferred from the user's bank account to their savings account.



IN-GAME PURCHASES:

1) Dragon Food - available in different pricing tiers to cater to different saving goals

2) Dragon Shop - skins, scales, wings, accessories and skill upgrades are available for one-time purchase 



GAME RULES:

\- Pet dragons will have to be fed regularly in weekly, fortnightly or monthly periods to be kept alive and healthy.

\- When a dragon runs out of food, if the dragon is not fed within the next 5 days, its health bar will deplete and it will die.

\- More customisations will be unlocked in the Dragon Shop as users reach higher savings milestones.

\- Dragons will age and grow bigger over time, which also unlocks premium customisation options.



## How we built it

We used Xcode and Swift to build the UI and plan to use DBS API to connect bank accounts in the backend. We also drew our own animations, logo and graphics to beautify the app!



## Challenges I ran into

It would be rather troublesome for us to implement the DBS API as we would have to connect our bank accounts. As first time "hackathoners", we also faced troubles debugging our codes in time, so some features like the shop is still not available :(



## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Our dragon animations, progress bar and timer count down worked! Yay.



## What I learned

Learned to code in Swift on the spot and how to do slightly more advanced features like transferring data between view controllers for our food "days left"count according to user's purchase.



## What's next for Dragon Dollars

We hope to complete the shop and menu interface and add an analytics section to show the user's average monthly savings and stuff like that.
